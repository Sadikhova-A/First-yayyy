* Extra Convenient To-Do App
  * Voice record from my phone. The app detects what I'm saying and uses simple AI to create a header for the task, rank its urgency and difficulty based on when I say its due, length of the transcription and data from previous tasks (after the task I'll edit the difficulty to train the AI).
  *  The transcription is going in the 'description' section of the to-do
