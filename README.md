# MY SOLDIERS RAGE!

The start of a journey, overwhelming how much there is to learn, but the more I learn the more I will be able to do. So many possibilities from here, gonna be fun. Some projects I wanna do in the future:

- A love letter: Website (html) that looks like a letter for Anthony. A letter when clicked a character comes out w flowers.
  - When mouse hovers over the character, it turns its back and blushes
  - When clicked says 'ouch' or smt
  - Cute dynamic backgound w hearts

* Extra Convenient To-Do App
  * Voice record from my phone. The app detects what I'm saying and uses simple AI to create a header for the task, rank its urgency and diffulty based on when I say its due, length of the transcription and data from previous tasks (after the task I'll edit the diffulty to train the AI).
  *  The transcribtion is going in the 'description' section of the to-do

- Smart Tic-Tac-Toe Game That Makes Fun of You
  - Game in the midlle and a (anime) character on the side that gets frustrated if you tie, makes fun of you if you lose but can never lose himself
  - Ask hubby to do voices for the character, will be sooo cute!!
  - Take still images of the character from Jojo maybe
